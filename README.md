# BMI-calculator
Heya!
I started learning nodejs today and it was very exciting...

So, basically the files named index.html is a very rudimentary html page consisting of a form where we just get to add the two numbers which we will be giving as input. 
But the interesting part is that the functioning will be from backend or server side, i.e., it won't be visible to the client like earlier we used to do in our local systems. 

Plus I have gone a step ahead to calculate your BMI based on the inputs of weight (in kg) and height (in metres) that you provide. This is just an extension of the previous explanation where instead of addition you implement a formula for the same. 

That's it I guess..
Thanks! :)
